== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does this plugin work? =

JTRT Responsive Tables works by converting tables in csv formats, into responsive html5 markup language. 

= How does the responsiveness work? =

This plugin uses FooTables to make the responsiveness happen. It 'hides' columns on smaller sizes so the table isn't squished and looking ugly. Although it hides columns, you can always view the hidden columns by clicking on the rows. 

= Do I need to know any HTML/CSS to use this plugin? =

No, everything happens in the backend using a live representation of your table. You can manually select which columns to hide on the tablet and mobile sizes just by clicking your mouse.
